# Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator application. It takes an arithmetic expression as an argument and returns the result.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
- **Follows the BODMAS/PEMDAS rule for order of operations (precedence of operators).**

## Usage

To use the calculator, run the `main.py` script with your expression enclosed in quotes:

```bash
python main.py "3 + 5 * 2"
```

This will output:

```json
{
    "expression": "3 + 5 * 2",
    "result": 13.0
}
```
